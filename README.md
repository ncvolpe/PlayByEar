A piano app that you can play 
This repository contains a React-based virtual piano application. Users can interact with the virtual piano using their keyboard, where each key corresponds to a musical note. The application supports both white and black keys, which change appearance when pressed to simulate the interaction with a real piano.

**Features:**

Keyboard Interaction: Users can play notes by pressing corresponding keys on their computer keyboard.

Audio Feedback: Each key press triggers a corresponding audio note playback.
Dynamic Key Visuals: Keys visually change color when pressed to provide interactive feedback.

**Technologies Used:**
React: Built using React library for frontend interface and component management.
JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript for application logic and event handling.
CSS: Styled with CSS for visual styling and key animations.
HTML5 Audio API: Utilized for audio playback functionality.
